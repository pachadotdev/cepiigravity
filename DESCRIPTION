Description: The Gravity database aims at gathering in a single place a set of 
    variables that could be useful to researchers or practitioners willing to 
    understand the determinants of international trade. Each observation 
    corresponds to a combination of exporter-importer-year (i.e. 
    origin-destination-year), for which we provide trade flows, as well as 
    geographic, cultural, trade facilitation and macroeconomic variables.
